# Natural Language Processing for National Student Survey Data
A workflow for dealing with UK National Student Survey free text data, based off presentation given at University of Edinburgh Learning and Teaching Conference 2018

## About
At the [University of Edinburgh Learning and Teaching Conference 2018](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/cpd/workshops/learning-teaching-conference) our team gave a presentation called 'What Do Edinburgh Students Want? A mixed methods approach to NSS free text data'. 

This repository has some examples of how I use NLP to explore a sensitive but important dataset like the National Student Survey

# Ethics
*It is extremely important that you do not share your institute's NSS data!*
NSS data is provided to institutions -  but you do not own that data. A copy of the NSS privacy statement is below, but the most important part for this workflow is here:

> ### How will the information I provide be used?
>Your responses to the NSS will be used solely for research purposes, which includes providing information to allow the UK HE funding bodies to fulfil their statutory roles. The results of this research will be anonymous and provided in the form of statistical information only. We can assure you that you will NOT be identifiable in any published results.

> Your participation in this research, together with your individual responses to the questions, will be kept strictly confidential in line with information security requirements and standards as agreed between Ipsos MORI and HEFCE. We can also assure you that any information you provide during this research will NOT be used for marketing, nor will we sell your information to any third parties. If you have any questions about the NSS, please contact the research team at thestudentsurvey@ipsos.com.

Institutions may *not* use NSS free text data to identify students, and that data must not be shared on repositories such as this.
